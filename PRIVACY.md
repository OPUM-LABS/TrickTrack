# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 28, 2026

**TrickTrack** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 1. Overview
TrickTrack is an **offline-first** application. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not store your personal data on our servers. Your trip history, settings, and vehicle data remain locally on your device.

## 2. Data We Collect & Permissions
To function correctly, the app requires specific permissions. Here is how and why we use them:

### A. Location Data (Background & Foreground)
* **What we collect:** Precise location data (GPS coordinates).
* **How we use it:** We use this data to calculate the distance of your trips and to record the start and end points of your route.
* **Background Usage:** TrickTrack collects location data even when the app is closed or not in use to enable **automatic trip tracking**. This allows the app to record your mileage while you drive without keeping the screen on.
* **Storage:** This data is stored locally in the internal database of your device. It is not transmitted to our servers.

### B. Bluetooth
* **How we use it:** We use Bluetooth permissions to detect when your phone connects to your car’s Bluetooth system. This acts as a trigger to automatically start or stop a trip.
* **Data:** We do not scan for or collect data on other nearby Bluetooth devices.

## 3. Third-Party Services
While we do not run our own servers, the app interacts with the following third-party service to provide address information:

* **Photon / OpenStreetMap:**
  When you view a trip, the app may send the GPS coordinates of the start and end points to the Photon API (based on OpenStreetMap data) to convert them into a readable address (e.g., "Street Name, City").
    * This data is processed ephemerally for the purpose of the search request and is subject to the [OpenStreetMap Privacy Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).

## 4. Data Storage & Backups
* **Local Storage:** All your data is stored securely on your device.
* **Backups:** The app allows you to create backups (JSON files). You are responsible for the security of these backup files if you choose to upload them to a third-party cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox). We do not have access to your backups.

## 5. User Rights
Since we do not store your data on central servers, you have full control:
* **Access & Portability:** You can export your data to CSV, PDF or JSON formats at any time via the app settings.
* **Deletion:** You can delete individual trips or clear all application data via the Android System Settings. Uninstalling the app permanently removes all data from the device (unless you have created an external backup).

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
